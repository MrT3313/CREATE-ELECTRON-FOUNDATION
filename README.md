## ðŸš§ Project Status: BETA ðŸš§

> [!WARNING]
>
> This project is in its early stages.  
> While it's ready for you to try out, expect breaking changes and incomplete features.  
> The best way to get these features implemented or improved is to participate ðŸ™‚

> [!NOTE]
>
> [Known Issues](https://github.com/MrT3313/CREATE-ELECTRON-FOUNDATION/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%28label%3Abug+OR+type%3ABug%29)

**Platform Support:**

- `create-electron-foundation` was developed and tested on **macOS**.
- **I have not done nearly enough testing on the final Electron production assets as I have been building towards local scaffolding first.**
- Windows _(and Linux if I can get pewdiepie on the line...)_ support is planned for the future, but full functionality is not **guaranteed** on those platforms.

## ðŸ‘€ Prerequisites ðŸ‘€

- `nvm`  
   To ensure compatibility and smooth development, it's generally recommended to use a Node.js version manager. These help you easily switch between Node.js versions as needed for different projects.

  This project management is strongly integrated with [**nvm**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and it is recommended that you have it installed on your machine when using create-electron-foundation or its scaffolded assets.

- `make`  
   This project uses a [makefile](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) to build & manage the project. There can be issues with Node.JS installs vs NVM depending on when each were installed.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > Please investigate your own system to confirm you have the ability to run a makefile command.  
  > If you are unsure please do not attempt to automatically install packages after scaffolding.

## What's Included?

`create-electron-foundation` scaffolds a project with a sensible default stack, but gives you the flexibility to opt out of what you don't need.

- **Framework:** [`Electron`](https://www.electronjs.org/) (with a modern main/renderer process setup)
- **Frontend:** [`React`](https://react.dev/) w/[`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (via [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev/))

You can choose to include:

- **Routing:** [`TanStack Router`](https://tanstack.com/router) or [`React Router`](https://reactrouter.com/)
- **Styling:** [`Tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/) or `Vanilla CSS`
- **Database:** [`SQLite*`](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- **ORM:** [`Drizzle ORM**`](https://orm.drizzle.team/) (when SQLite is selected)

_\*optional_  
_\*\*optional : required if Database selected_

## Getting Started

To create a new Electron application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-electron-foundation@latest
npx create-electron-foundation # will call @latest

# to access other builds
npx create-electron-foundation@beta
npx create-electron-foundation@alpha
```

The CLI will guide you through a few interactive prompts to configure your project.

### Quick Start (Default Configuration)

To skip the prompts and scaffold a project with the default options, use the `-y` flag:

```bash
npx create-electron-foundation -y
```

## Command-Line Arguments

You can also customize your project setup directly via command-line arguments.
