# ==================================================================================================
# SUMMARY
# ==================================================================================================
# This file defines the main Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for the project.
#
# Purpose:
#   To automatically build, lint, format-check, and type-check the project's codebase whenever
#   changes are pushed to the 'main' branch or when a pull request is created/updated.
#   Its primary goal is to ensure code quality, consistency, and build integrity before merging
#   changes.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Push events to the 'main' branch.
#   - Pull request events (targeting any branch).
#
# Key Jobs & Steps:
#   1. lint-format (Job):
#      - Checks out the code.
#      - Sets up the Node.js environment using the local './.github/actions/setup' composite action
#        (which installs Node.js, caches dependencies, and runs 'npm ci').
#      - Runs 'npm run lint' to perform static code analysis and identify potential errors/style issues.
#      - Runs 'npm run format:check' to verify code formatting against defined project styles.
#
#   2. type-check (Job):
#      - Checks out the code.
#      - Sets up the Node.js environment (via './.github/actions/setup').
#      - Runs 'npm run build -w @create-electron-foundation/cli -- --noEmit' to perform TypeScript type checking
#        for the CLI workspace without generating build artifacts.
#
#   3. build-cli (Job):
#      - Depends on the successful completion of 'lint-format' and 'type-check' jobs.
#      - Checks out the code.
#      - Sets up the Node.js environment (via './.github/actions/setup').
#      - Runs 'npm run build' to compile/build the CLI application (specifically the CLI workspace).
#
#   4. unit-integration-tests (Job - Currently Commented Out):
#      - Placeholder for running automated unit and integration tests.
#      - Would typically depend on 'build-cli' and use 'npm test' or similar.
#
# Overall Flow:
#   The workflow ensures that basic code quality checks (linting, formatting, type safety) pass and
#   that the CLI application can be successfully built before any code is considered for merging
#   into the main branch. It uses a reusable composite action for environment setup to maintain
#   consistency and reduce redundancy.

# Defines a collection of jobs that run as part of this workflow.
jobs:
  # First job: Linting and formatting checks.
  lint-format:
    # Name of the job, displayed on the GitHub Actions UI.
    name: Lint & Format
    # Specifies the type of runner the job will run on.
    # ubuntu-latest uses the latest stable version of Ubuntu provided by GitHub.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Contains a sequence of tasks called steps that will be executed as part of the job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code.
      # This action checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Read Node.js version from .nvmrc file
      - name: Read .nvmrc
        id: nvm
        run: echo "NODE_VERSION=$(cat .nvmrc)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # Step 3: Setup the environment using a local composite action.
      # This refers to the action defined in ./.github/actions/setup/action.yml
      - name: Setup Environment
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup # Use the local composite action
        with:
          # Input: Specify the Node.js version for the setup action, read from .nvmrc
          node-version: ${{ steps.nvm.outputs.NODE_VERSION }}

      # Step 4: Run the linting command.
      # This runs the "lint" script from your root package.json: "npm run lint -w @create-electron-foundation/cli"
      # which in turn runs "eslint . --ext .ts,.js --fix" in the cli workspace.
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 5: Run the formatting check command.
      # This runs the "format:check" script from your root package.json: "npm run format:check -w @create-electron-foundation/cli"
      # which in turn runs "prettier --check ." in the cli workspace.
      - name: Format Check
        run: npm run format:check

  # Second job: Type checking (e.g., for TypeScript).
  type-check:

        with:
          node-version: ${{ steps.nvm.outputs.NODE_VERSION }}

      # Step to run the type checking command.
      # This effectively runs "tsc --noEmit" within the context of the CLI workspace build script.
      # It assumes your "build" script in "cli/package.json" (tsc -p tsconfig.json) can accept additional arguments like --noEmit.
      - name: Type Check

  # Third job: Build the CLI application.

    # It will only start after both those jobs have completed successfully.
